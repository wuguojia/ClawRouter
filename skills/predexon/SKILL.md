## Notes

- Payment is automatic via x402 — deducted from the user's BlockRun wallet
- If payment fails, tell the user to fund their wallet at [blockrun.ai](https://blockrun.ai)
- Retry once on 502 — Predexon can occasionally be slow
- Always read from `response.data` — every response is wrapped `{ data: ... }`
- Synthesize data into plain-language analysis — never dump raw JSON
