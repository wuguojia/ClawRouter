# Stop Overpaying for Claude: How ClawRouter Cuts Your Anthropic Bill by 70%

_You love Claude. Your wallet doesn't. Here's how to keep frontier-quality answers — at a fraction of the cost._

---

## The Problem: Claude Is Brilliant, But Expensive

If you're building with the Anthropic API, you already know Claude is the best reasoning model available. Opus 4.6 runs $5/$25 per million tokens. Sonnet at $3/$15. Even Haiku costs $1/$5.

But here's what most developers won't admit: **the majority of your API calls don't need Claude.**

Think about your typical workload. You're building a SaaS app. Some requests need Claude's reasoning — debugging complex code, analyzing long documents, orchestrating multi-step agent workflows. But most requests are mundane: extracting JSON from text, answering simple user questions, translating a string, summarizing a paragraph.

You're paying $3-25 per million tokens for work that a $0.10 model handles identically.

**The problem is simple:** you're paying Claude rates on 100% of your requests, but only ~30% of them need Claude.

---

## What Does a Typical Developer Workload Look Like?

### The Everyday Tasks (~70% of requests)

These are the requests you fire off constantly and barely think about:

- **"Extract the name and email from this text and return JSON"** — Any model can do this. You're paying Claude $15/M output tokens for structured extraction that a $0.40 model handles perfectly.

- **"Summarize this customer support ticket in 2 sentences"** — Summarization is a solved problem. You don't need frontier reasoning here.

- **"Translate this error message to Spanish"** — Translation is a commodity task. Paying Claude rates for it is like taking a Lamborghini to the grocery store.

- **"What's the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?"** — Factual Q&A. Every model gets this right.

- **"Convert this CSV data to a markdown table"** — Pure formatting. A free model does this identically.

### The Tasks That Actually Need Claude (~30% of requests)

This is where you're paying for real value:

- **Complex code generation** — "Refactor this authentication module to support OAuth2 + PKCE, handle token refresh, and add rate limiting." Multi-file, multi-constraint reasoning. Claude earns its price here.

- **Long-document analysis** — "Read this 50-page contract and identify all clauses that could expose us to liability over $1M." Context window + reasoning quality matter.

- **Multi-step agent orchestration** — "Scan these 5 APIs, cross-reference the data, and generate a report with recommendations." Agentic workflows where the model needs to maintain a plan across many steps.

- **Advanced reasoning** — "Debug this race condition in our distributed system" or "Prove this algorithm is O(n log n)." Tasks where cheaper models lose the thread.

## The Solution: ClawRouter

[ClawRouter](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter) is an open-source local proxy that sits between your app and 41+ AI models. It saves you money in three ways: **smart routing**, **token optimization**, and **response caching**.

## How You Save: Three Layers

### Layer 1: Smart Routing (the biggest win)

ClawRouter scores every prompt against 14 dimensions in <1ms and routes it to the cheapest model that can handle the task.

```
"What is the capital of France?"
  → SIMPLE → nvidia/gpt-oss-120b (FREE)

"Extract JSON from this text"
  → SIMPLE → nvidia/gpt-oss-120b (FREE)

"Refactor this auth module with OAuth2 + PKCE"
  → COMPLEX → anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6 ($3/$15)

"Prove sqrt(2) is irrational, show every step"
  → REASONING → xai/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning ($0.20/$0.50)
```

From real production data across 20,000+ paying user requests:

| Model                 | % of Requests | Price (input/output per M) |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| gemini-2.5-flash-lite | 34.5%         | $0.10 / $0.40              |
| **claude-sonnet-4.6** | **22.7%**     | **$3.00 / $15.00**         |
| kimi-k2.5             | 16.2%         | $0.60 / $3.00              |
| minimax-m2.5          | 6.5%          | $0.30 / $1.20              |
| grok-code-fast        | 6.1%          | $0.20 / $1.50              |
| claude-haiku-4.5      | 2.7%          | $1.00 / $5.00              |
| nvidia/gpt-oss-120b   | 2.1%          | FREE                       |
| grok-reasoning        | 2.9%          | $0.20 / $0.50              |
| Others                | 6.3%          | varies                     |

**Result:** 77% of requests go to models that cost 5-150x less than Sonnet. Only the ~23% that genuinely need Claude still go to Claude.

### Layer 2: Token Compression (saves on every request)

Even when a request does go to Claude, ClawRouter reduces the tokens you pay for. The proxy runs a multi-layer compression pipeline on your request **before** sending it to the provider — and you pay based on the **compressed** token count, not the original.

**How it works:**

| Compression Layer            | What It Does                                           | Savings |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| **Deduplication**            | Removes duplicate messages in conversation history     | 2-5%    |
| **Whitespace normalization** | Strips excess whitespace, trailing spaces, empty lines | 3-8%    |
| **JSON compaction**          | Minifies JSON in tool calls and results                | 2-4%    |

These three layers are **enabled by default** and are completely safe — they don't change semantic meaning. The compression triggers automatically on requests larger than 180KB (common in agent workflows and long conversations).

**For agent-heavy workloads** (long tool outputs, multi-turn conversations), the savings are even larger. An optional observation compression layer can reduce massive tool outputs by up to 97% — turning 10KB of verbose log output into 300 characters of essential information.

**Typical combined savings: 7-15% fewer tokens per request.** On long-context agent workloads: 20-40%.

This matters most on expensive models. If you're sending a 50K-token agent conversation to Claude Sonnet, 15% compression saves ~$0.03 per request — that adds up to real money at scale.

### Layer 3: Response Cache + Request Deduplication (saves 100%)

ClawRouter caches responses locally. If your app sends the same request within 10 minutes, you get an instant response at **zero cost** — no API call, no tokens billed.

This is more common than you'd think:

- **Retry logic** — Your app retries on timeout. Without dedup, you pay twice. With ClawRouter, the retry resolves from cache instantly.
- **Redundant requests** — Multiple users or processes asking the same thing? One API call, multiple responses.
- **Agent loops** — Agentic frameworks often re-query with identical context. Cache catches these.

```
Request 1: "Summarize this document" → API call → $0.02 → cached
Request 2: "Summarize this document" → cache hit → $0.00 → instant
Request 3: "Summarize this document" → cache hit → $0.00 → instant
```

The deduplicator also catches in-flight duplicates: if two identical requests arrive simultaneously, only one goes to the provider. Both callers get the same response.

## The Cost Math (Honest Numbers)

**10,000 mixed requests per month**, averaging 1,000 input tokens and 500 output tokens each.

### Direct Anthropic API

| Approach          | Input (10M tokens) | Output (5M tokens) | Monthly Total |

## How the 14-Dimension Router Works

ClawRouter runs a weighted scoring algorithm on every prompt — entirely locally, in under 1 millisecond, zero external API calls.

| Dimension            | Weight | Detects                                    |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Reasoning Markers    | 0.18   | "prove," "step by step," "analyze"         |
| Code Presence        | 0.15   | `function`, `class`, `import`, code blocks |
| Multi-Step Patterns  | 0.12   | "first...then," numbered steps             |
| Technical Terms      | 0.10   | Domain-specific vocabulary                 |
| Token Count          | 0.08   | Short vs. long context                     |
| Question Complexity  | 0.05   | Nested or compound questions               |
| Creative Markers     | 0.05   | Creative writing indicators                |
| Constraint Count     | 0.04   | "max," "minimum," "at most"                |
| Imperative Verbs     | 0.03   | "create," "generate," "build"              |
| Output Format        | 0.03   | JSON, YAML, table, markdown                |
| Simple Indicators    | 0.02   | "what is," "define," "translate"           |
| Reference Complexity | 0.02   | "the code above," "the docs"               |
| Domain Specificity   | 0.02   | Quantum, genomics, etc.                    |
| Negation Complexity  | 0.01   | "don't," "never," "avoid"                  |

The weighted score maps to four tiers:

```
Score < 0.0   →  SIMPLE     →  Free or ultra-cheap models
Score 0.0–0.3 →  MEDIUM     →  Mid-tier (Kimi K2.5, DeepSeek)
Score 0.3–0.5 →  COMPLEX    →  Frontier (Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro)
Score > 0.5   →  REASONING  →  Specialized (Grok Reasoning, DeepSeek-R)
```

Multilingual support across 9 languages. Tool-calling and vision requests automatically filter for compatible models. If the primary model fails, a fallback chain tries alternatives before returning an error.

## Getting Started: 3 Minutes

### Step 1: Install

```bash
npx w/apirouter
```

Starts a local proxy on port 8402. Auto-generates a crypto wallet. Done.

### Step 2: Update Your Code

**Python** — change 2 lines:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8402/v1",  # ← was: https://api.anthropic.com
    api_key="unused"                       # ← ClawRouter handles auth
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="blockrun/auto",                 # ← was: claude-sonnet-4.6
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt here"}]
)
```

**TypeScript** — same idea:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:8402/v1",
  apiKey: "unused",
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "blockrun/auto", // or "eco" for max savings, "premium" for best quality
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Your prompt here" }],
});
```

**Routing profiles:**

- `blockrun/auto` — Balanced cost/quality (default)
- `blockrun/eco` — Maximum savings (free tier aggressively)
- `blockrun/premium` — Best quality (Opus/Sonnet/GPT-5)
- `blockrun/free` — Free tier only (gpt-oss-120b)

### Step 3: Fund (optional)

```bash
# Your wallet address is shown on startup.
# Send any amount of USDC on Base chain to that address.
# $1 is enough for hundreds of requests.
# Or start with $0 — the free tier model works immediately.
```

That's it. Your existing code works. Your output quality on complex tasks stays the same.

## Why ClawRouter Instead of OpenRouter?

|                        | ClawRouter                                          | OpenRouter                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Smart routing**      | Automatic — 14-dimension scorer picks the model     | Manual — you pick the model        |
| **Token optimization** | Built-in compression (7-15% savings)                | None                               |
| **Response caching**   | Local cache, repeat requests = $0                   | None                               |
| **Request dedup**      | Retries don't double-bill                           | None                               |
| **Routing latency**    | <1ms (local, on your machine)                       | Additional network hop             |
| **Payments**           | Non-custodial USDC on Base (your wallet, your keys) | Prepaid credit balance (custodial) |
| **Free tier**          | GPT-OSS-120B (always available)                     | No free models                     |
| **API keys**           | Zero — proxy handles all auth                       | You manage keys per provider       |
| **Algorithm**          | Open-source, MIT license, modify it yourself        | Proprietary                        |

The fundamental difference: **OpenRouter is a model marketplace where you choose.** ClawRouter is an intelligent proxy that **chooses for you**, compresses your tokens, caches your responses, and pays per-request with crypto from your own wallet.
