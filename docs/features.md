## Response Cache

ClawRouter includes LLM response caching inspired by LiteLLM's caching system. Identical requests return cached responses, saving both cost and latency.

**How it works:**

```
Request: "What is 2+2?"
  First call:  → API ($0.001) → Cache response
  Second call: → Cache HIT → Return instantly ($0)
```

**Features:**

| Feature      | Default     | Description                |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| TTL          | 10 minutes  | Responses expire after TTL |
| Max size     | 200 entries | LRU eviction when full     |
| Item limit   | 1MB         | Large responses skipped    |
| Auto-enabled | Yes         | No config needed           |

**Cache key generation:**

The cache key is a SHA-256 hash of the request body (model + messages + params), with normalization:

- Message timestamps stripped (OpenClaw injects `[Mon 2024-01-15 10:30 UTC]`)
- Keys sorted for consistent hashing
- Stream mode, user, and request_id fields excluded

**Bypass cache:**

```typescript
// Via header
fetch("/v1/chat/completions", {
  headers: { "Cache-Control": "no-cache" }
})

// Via body
{
  "model": "blockrun/auto",
  "cache": false,  // or "no_cache": true
  "messages": [...]
}
```

**Check cache stats:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8402/cache
```

Response:

```json
{
  "size": 42,
  "maxSize": 200,
  "hits": 156,
  "misses": 89,
  "evictions": 3,
  "hitRate": "63.7%"
}
```

**Configuration:**

Response caching is enabled by default with sensible defaults. For advanced tuning, the cache can be configured programmatically:

```typescript
import { ResponseCache } from "w/apirouter";

const cache = new ResponseCache({
  maxSize: 500, // Max cached responses
  defaultTTL: 300, // 5 minutes
  maxItemSize: 2_097_152, // 2MB max per item
  enabled: true,
});
```

## Agentic Auto-Detection

ClawRouter automatically detects multi-step agentic tasks and routes to models optimized for autonomous execution:

```
"what is 2+2"                    → gemini-flash (standard)
"build the project then run tests" → kimi-k2.5 (auto-agentic)
"fix the bug and make sure it works" → kimi-k2.5 (auto-agentic)
```

**How it works:**

- Detects agentic keywords: file ops ("read", "edit"), execution ("run", "test", "deploy"), iteration ("fix", "debug", "verify")
- Threshold: 2+ signals triggers auto-switch to agentic tiers
- No config needed — works automatically

**Agentic tier models** (optimized for multi-step autonomy):

| Tier      | Agentic Model     | Why                            |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| SIMPLE    | claude-haiku-4.5  | Fast + reliable tool use       |
| MEDIUM    | kimi-k2.5         | 200+ tool chains, 76% cheaper  |
| COMPLEX   | claude-sonnet-4.6 | Best balance for complex tasks |
| REASONING | kimi-k2.5         | Extended reasoning + execution |

### Force Agentic Mode

You can also force agentic mode via config:

```yaml
# openclaw.yaml
plugins:
  - id: "w/apirouter"
    config:
      routing:
        overrides:
          agenticMode: true # Always use agentic tiers
```

---

## Tool Detection

When your request includes a `tools` array (function calling), ClawRouter automatically switches to agentic tiers:

```typescript
// Request with tools → auto-agentic mode
{
  model: "blockrun/auto",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Check the weather" }],
  tools: [{ type: "function", function: { name: "get_weather", ... } }]
}
// → Routes to claude-haiku-4.5 (excellent tool use)
// → Instead of gemini-flash (may produce malformed tool calls)
```

**Why this matters:** Some models (like `deepseek-reasoner`) are optimized for chain-of-thought reasoning but can generate malformed tool calls. Tool detection ensures requests with functions go to models proven to handle tool use correctly.

---

## Context-Length-Aware Routing

ClawRouter automatically filters out models that can't handle your context size:

```
150K token request:
  Full chain: [grok-4-fast (131K), deepseek (128K), kimi (262K), gemini (1M)]
  Filtered:   [kimi (262K), gemini (1M)]
  → Skips models that would fail with "context too long" errors
```

This prevents wasted API calls and faster fallback to capable models.

---

## Model Aliases

Use short aliases instead of full model paths:

```bash
/model free      # gpt-oss-120b (FREE!)
/model br-sonnet # anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6
/model br-opus   # anthropic/claude-opus-4
/model br-haiku  # anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
/model gpt       # openai/gpt-4o
/model gpt5      # openai/gpt-5.2
/model deepseek  # deepseek/deepseek-chat
/model reasoner  # deepseek/deepseek-reasoner
/model kimi      # nvidia/kimi-k2.5 (reliable); /model kimi-k2.6 for Moonshot flagship
/model gemini    # google/gemini-2.5-pro
/model flash     # google/gemini-2.5-flash
/model grok      # xai/grok-3
/model grok-fast # xai/grok-4-fast-reasoning
```

All aliases work with `/model blockrun/xxx` or just `/model xxx`.

---

## Free Tier Fallback

When your wallet balance hits $0, ClawRouter automatically falls back to the free model (`gpt-oss-120b`):

```
Wallet: $0.00
Request: "Help me write a function"
→ Routes to gpt-oss-120b (FREE)
→ No "insufficient funds" error
→ Keep building while you top up
```

You'll never get blocked by an empty wallet — the free tier keeps you running.

---

## Session Persistence

For multi-turn conversations, ClawRouter pins the model to prevent mid-task switching:

```
Turn 1: "Build a React component" → claude-sonnet-4.6
Turn 2: "Add dark mode support"   → claude-sonnet-4.6 (pinned)
Turn 3: "Now add tests"           → claude-sonnet-4.6 (pinned)
```

Sessions are identified by conversation ID and persist for 1 hour of inactivity.
